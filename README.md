# Tools for synesthesia research 

This is a repository links to the repositories of various programs for researching synesthesia. All of the programs were made for a study for the [Tutki Kokeile Kehit√§ 2021 competition](https://tukoke.tek.fi/). The programs are as follows:

* [analysis](https://github.com/intoalmiala/tukoke2021-analysis): code used to process and analyze our data in order to get meaningful results
* [colorpicker](https://github.com/intoalmiala/tukoke2021-colorpicker): a program that plays audio files and takes color inputs from the user for each file
* [recorder](https://github.com/intoalmiala/tukoke2021-recorder): a program for efficiently recording a large amount of audio files

Details on usage and functionality are provided in each tool's own repository.
